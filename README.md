A retail company “ABC Private Limited” wants to understand the customer purchase behaviour (specifically, purchase amount) against various products of different categories. They have shared purchase summary of various customers for selected high volume products from last month. The data set also contains customer demographics (age, gender, marital status, city_type, stay_in_current_city), product details (product_id and product category) and Total purchase_amount from last month.

In this code the prediction is done using the Decision Tree Regressor and its clearly not the best solution for the problem. Still working for the improvement.
